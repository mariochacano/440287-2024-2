Greetings and Welcome, I invite you to review the content and participate actively in each activities and subjects that we will discuss on the course.

### R Language
The main Language for programming on this course is R, R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

##### First Install Language & R GUI
[The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/)

##### Second Install the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R
[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

If you do not have the option to install it on your personal computer, you can run it from a ephemeral environment as follows:
##### R Binder (Online)
RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mariochacano/r/main?urlpath=rstudio)

Jupyter+R: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mariochacano/r/main?filepath=index.ipynb)

### Packages
| Package | Description | Webpage |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Rcmdr | R Commander: A platform-independent basic-statistics GUI (graphical user interface) for R, based on the tcltk package. | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html |
| rriskDistributions | Collection of functions for fitting distributions to given data or by known quantiles. Two main functions fit.perc() and fit.cont() provide users a GUI that allows to choose a most appropriate distribution without any knowledge of the R syntax. Note, this package is a part of the 'rrisk' project | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rriskDistributions/index.html |
| tidyverse | The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. | https://www.tidyverse.org/ |
| fitdistrplus | Extends the fitdistr() function (of the MASS package) with several functions to help the fit of a parametric distribution to non-censored or censored data. Censored data may contain left censored, right censored and interval censored values, with several lower and upper bounds. In addition to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the package provides moment matching (MME), quantile matching (QME), maximum goodness-of-fit estimation (MGE) and maximum spacing estimation (MSE) methods (available only for non-censored data). Weighted versions of MLE, MME, QME and MSE are available. See e.g. Casella & Berger (2002), Statistical inference, Pacific Grove, for a general introduction to parametric estimation. | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/index.html |
